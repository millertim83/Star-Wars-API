# Star Wars API app

This project was built with the Create React App tool, and uses Bootstrap v5 for styling.  The app renders data from the swapi.dev Star Wars API.  It was my second React project as part of the Software Development Mastermind program, and my first experience with an API.

## Summary

[Live deployment] (https://star-wars-api-app-1.herokuapp.com)

The app displays a table of characters from the swapi.dev API.  Users can click the page numbers at the bottom to view more characters, or enter searches (partial names work!) at the top to find specific characters.

This project forced me to take a big step up in my programming journey.  I learned how to make API calls and render specific data in a React app.

In React, I learned a lot about:
  -how Components pass data to each other to render asynchronous code
  -how 'state' works, and the differences in how it's used in class and function components
  -how to handle using 'this'
  
### Future features to add
I plan on adding a loading spinner to show the user the app is working properly as it renders the data.
Also, I'd like to expand the search functionality beyond just character names.
